    <p>Here's how the Race to 13 pool works: Entries are $10 each. Each entry is randomly assigned an MLB team. When a game ends, the runs are recorded for both teams. The first entry to get all numbers from 0 to 13 wins!</p>

      <h2>It's easy</h2>
      <p>All you have to do is buy an entry and you've got a fair chance. There's no draft. No baseball knowledge is required.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Set it and forget it</h2>
      <p>The runs pool doesn't require constant updating in order to win. You can check current standings but it's totally optional.</p>

      <h2>Are we there yet?</h2>
      <p>We might have a winner in as few as 14 games... or it might take the entire 162-game season. Like a ballgame, no one knows how long this will take!</p>
